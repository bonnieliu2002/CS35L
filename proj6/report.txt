I started by implementing tr2b.c. I knew tr2b.c took 2 inputs.
After doing some research online, I found that the name by which
the program is called will be counted as the first argument, so in
reality, we want exactly 3 arguments for this program. If argc,
which is argument count, was less than 3, I printed to stderr that
there were not enough arguments and exited. If argc was greater
than 3, I printed to stderr that there were too many arguments and
exited. Then I set a constant pointer to an array of characters
called from to argv[1] (the first input). Similarly, I set another
constant pointer to an array of characters called to to argv[2].
Using strlen, I found each of their sizes, and if they weren't
equal to each other, I printed to stderr that the string lengths
were not equal and exited. Next, I made sure that from did not
possess 2 or more of the same letters. To make this process easier,
I copied each character of from and put it in an array of
characters. Then I sorted this new array and afterwards used
another for loop to check if any 2 letters were the same. If there
were duplicates, I immediately printed to stderr that from has
duplicate bytes and exited.

If the program made it to this point, that means that we can start
printing the characters! I made a function called printChar that
takes in a character and 2 constant pointers to different
characters. Inside printChar, I looped through the array of
characters from was pointing at, and if any element inside from
equaled the character passed in, I printed the character in to 
corresponding to the same index and returned. If the character
passed in did not equal any letter in from, I simply printed the
original character out.

I tested tr2b.c by copying and pasting the following sentence into
a test file I created: Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs. I
chose this sentence because it's a pangram, meaning it contains all
letters of the alphabet. Here are a few of the test cases I ran
after compiling it.
$ gcc tr2b.c -g -o tr2b
$ ./tr2b "abc" "xyz" < testFile
Pxzk my yox with five dozen liquor jugs.
$ ./tr2b "Pack" "Eats" < testFile
Eats my box with five dozen liquor jugs.
$ ./tr2b "Pack." "Eats" < testFile
Eats my box with five dozen liquor jugs?

For tr2u.c, I copied my code from tr2b.c by typing the following:
$ cp tr2b.c tr2u.c

Then I vimmed into tr2u.c. I replaced all the printf statements
with write statements. Read and write statements take 3 inputs:
file descriptor, buffer to read data from, and length of buffer, in
that order. For the write statements, I made an array of characters
that held the error message so that I could easily use strlen on
the array instead of counting the number of characters.

Once I got to the while loop, I had to read from standard input.
I made a pointer that pointed to a dynamically allocated character.
I then dereferenced the pointer and passed that character into
printChar. If the read had an error, however, I would print an
error message to stderr, free c_pointer, and exit. If there was no
error, the program would run printChar (see description below).
Upon running printChar, the program would free c_pointer and then
dynamically allocate 1 byte to it to hold exactly 1 character.

In printChar, I made some minor changes. I made another character
variable called outputMe, which was set initially to c. If any
letter in from equals c, I would set outputMe to the corresponding
element in to with the same index as the from element and break.
Outside the loop, I wrote the contents of outputMe into stdout.

After compiling it, I ran the same test cases listed above, except
this time I called tr2u instead of tr2b.
$ gcc tr2u.c -g -o tr2u

The program passed all the test cases, so I moved on to generating
a large file of random charactes by using Python.

I typed the following command in Putty:
$ vim genRandChars.py

In the file, I typed the following:
#!/usr/bin/python

import random, string

random = ''.join([random.choice(string.ascii_letters + string.digits) for n in xrange(6000000)])
print random

Then I typed the following commands in Linux:
$ chmod +x genRandChars.py
$ python genRandChars.py > bigTest

bigTest thus held 6 million randomly generated characters. Next, I
used strace after researching online about how to use it. I found
the -c option produces a summary in a helpful table. First, I
compared the system calls issued by my tr2b and tr2u commands when
copying one file to another.
$ strace -c ./tr2b "abc" "xyz" < bigTest > output

The buffered command took less than 1 second to complete while the
unbuffered one took almost 1 minute to finish. That's because the
buffered command made only 1494 calls while the unbuffered command
made 12000029 calls.

Next, I compared the system calls issued by my tr2b and tr2u
commands when copying a file to my terminal.

Once again, it's evident that the unbuffered command took far
longer than the buffered command. The buffered command took only
6621 calls and 0.017913 seconds to run while the unbuffered command
took a whopping 12000029 calls and 57.373110 seconds to run.

Next, I tried running the time command to measure how much faster
one program is, compared to the other, when copying the same amount
of data.
$ time ./tr2b "abc" "xyz" < bigTest > output2

real    0m0.257s
user    0m0.190s
sys     0m0.013s
$ time ./tr2u "abc" "xyz" < bigTest > output3

real    0m13.448s
user    0m2.117s
sys     0m11.211s

We see that the buffered program takes only 0.257 seconds to copy
one file to another while the unbuffered command takes 13.448
seconds to do so. That's a 13.191-second difference, and the
buffered program is approximately 52 times faster than the
unbuffered one!

I then examined how long it took for each program to copy a file to
terminal:
$ time ./tr2b "abc" "xyz" < bigTest

real    0m2.515s
user    0m0.285s
sys     0m0.048s
$ time ./tr2u "abc" "xyz" < bigTest

real    0m12.538s
user    0m2.041s
sys     0m10.478s

We see that the buffered program takes only 2.515 seconds to copy a
file to terminal while the unbuffered command takes 12.538 seconds
to do the same. That's a 10.023-second difference, and the buffered
program is almost 5 times faster than the unbuffered one!

Report
------------

I used a Python script to generate test files with 0, 100, 10000,
and 1000000 lines, and I used the time command to measure how much
time it took to run each test file. The values seen under the sfrob
and sfrobu columns are the sys time result.
 size of  |  ./sfrob    |  ./sfrobu
test file | runtime (s) | runtime (s)
-------------------------------------
    0     |    0.001    |    0.001
   100    |    0.002    |    0.01
  10000   |    0.021    |    0.869
 1000000  |    1.948    |   87.109

I estimated the CPU time cost as a function of the number of input
lines by using these data points to graph two lines in Python and
finding the lines of best fit.

from numpy import *

x = array([0, 100, 10000, 1000000])
sfrob = array([0.001, 0.002, 0.021, 1.948])
sfrobu = array([0.001, 0.01, 0.869, 87.109])

from scipy.interpolate import *
p1 = polyfit(x,sfrob,1)
p2 = polyfit(x,sfrobu,1)
print(p1)
print(p2)

from matplotlib.pyplot import *
plot(x,sfrob,'o')
plot(x,sfrobu,'-')
show()

Using the program above, I came up with the following equations:
runtime of sfrob(size of test file) ~= 1.95e-06*(size of test file)+1.45e-03
runtime of sfrobu(size of test file) ~= 8.71e-05*(size of test file)+7.39e-05

We see that the slope of sfrobu is much greater, meaning the
unbuffered sfrob command takes more time to run. This is consistent
with our findings in the lab.

Next, I ran a bunch of strace commands to determine which system
calls the program would use and what their calls's arguments would
look like on Linux systems if the assignment were changed so that
the rewritten program also had to use system calls rather than
<stdlib.h> memory allocation functions such as malloc, reallocfree.
$ strace ./sfrobu < zero
$ strace ./sfrobu < hundred
$ strace ./sfrobu < tenThousand
$ strace ./sfrobu < million
$ strace ./sfrobu < testFile
$ strace printf '*~BO *{_CIA *hXE]D *LER #@_GZY #E\\OX #^BO #FKPS #NEM\4' |
  ./sfrob |
  od -ta

I found the program used brk() and mmap(). Upon doing more research,
I found that brk() and sbrk() changes the location of the program
break, which defines the end of the process's data segment. mmap(),
on the other hand, creates a new mapping in the virtual address
space of the calling process. The function declarations for brk()
and mmap() are listed below:
#include <unistd.h>
int brk(void *end_data_segment);
#include <sys/mman.h>
void *mmap(void *addr, size_t length, int prot, int flags, int fd, off_t offset);

This means brk() will take in a pointer that will be set to the end
of the available space while mmap() will take in an address, a size
called length, an integer prototype, possible flags, file destination,
and a signed integer type.
