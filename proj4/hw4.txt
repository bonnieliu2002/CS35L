Homework
------------

1. The patch slightly lowers the time performance of ls because it has to make
sure not to display . and ..
2. If the company adopts this patched version of Coreutils instead of the
default one, it should watch out for past usages of ls -a -A. If previously,
the desired output from ls -a -A is effectively the same thing as ls -a, then
after patching, ls -a -A will no longer produce the same output. Thus to avoid
this error, the company should update any instances of ls -a -A where the
desired output is actually ls -a to ls -a.
3. /dev/null is an empty file, so trying to invoke the script on an empty file
doesn't work and returns an index out of range error. This is because at line
34, the program tries to call random.choice(self.lines). Random raises an 
IndexError if self.lines is empty.
4. I get an IOError due to invalid syntax. In Python3, except IOError as 
(errno, strerror): is not valid syntax.
5. When I run my shuf.py script with Python2 rather than Python3, I get a
SyntaxError because while Python3 recognizes tick marks (`), Python2 does not
and calls it a Non-ASCII character.
