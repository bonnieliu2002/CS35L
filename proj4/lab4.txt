In order to verify the problem, I copied the la script into my own shell
script.
	#!/bin/sh
	exec ls -a "$@"
I made this script executable by typing
	chmod +x la
Then I made a brand new directory called test and made two files within it
called .foo and bar.
	mkdir test
	cd test
	touch .foo
	touch bar
Then I ran ./la -A, which did indeed output ., .., .foo, and bar, as stated
in the spec, thus verifying the problem. I checked the Coreutils version that
/usr/bin/ls corresponds to by typing
	/usr/bin/ls -- version
and I found that this was version 8.22.

I started by downloading the Coreutils 8.29 source code compressed tarball,
its signature, and its GNU keyring. Then I ran
	gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig
I got the following result:
	gpg: Signature made Wed 27 Dec 2017 10:29:05 AM PST using RSA key ID 306037D9
	gpg: Good signature from "Pádraig Brady <P@draigBrady.com>"
	gpg:                 aka "Pádraig Brady <pbrady@redhat.com>"
	gpg:                 aka "Pádraig Brady <pixelbeat@gnu.org>"
	gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
	gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
	Primary key fingerprint: 6C37 DC12 121A 5006 BC1D  B804 DF6F D971 3060 37D9
This warning occurred because I downloaded the signature online.

Next, I unzipped the coreutils-8.29.tar.xz file. The -x tag means extract; the
-f tag means use archive file; the -v tag makes tar operate verbosely (gets 
extended info); and the -z tag tells tar to read or write archives through
gzip, which allows tar to directly operate on several kinds of compressed 
archives transparently.
	tar -xzvf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz

After that, I made another directory called coreutilsinstall and ran 
./configure:
	mkdir coreutilsinstall
	cd ..
	cd coreutils-8.29
	./configure --prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/bonniel/Desktop/CS35L/coreutilsinstall
The prefix flag meant install files in the coreutilsinstall directory.

Then I compiled using make and then used make install.
	make
	make install

Next, I copy and pasted the contents of the patch of Bug #30963 Message #10
into a file I named mypatch. The -p1 flag strips one level of directory.
	vim mypatch
	patch -p1 < mypatch
There were a hunk failed message, which could indicate the similarities of a
hunk don't match what's in the original file.

Then I compiled using make then make install again.
	make
	make install

To test if the patch worked, I tested it on the bin directory.
	cd ..
	cd test
	cd bin
	./ls -A
Prior to the patch, ./ls -A would have printed all the directories, including
. and 
.., but after applying the patch, it omitted the . and .. from the list.
